* Description
A spacemacs layer for Factor language support.

* Install
This layer depends on the elisp files that are bundled with factor.  To use this
layer, make sure that factor is installed and the bundled elisp files are picked
up by emacs (usually somewhere in site-lisp).

To use this layer, add it to your =./spacemacs= file.  Add =factor= to the
=dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list there.
